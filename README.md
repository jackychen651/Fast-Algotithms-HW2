# Fast-Algotithms-HW2

This repository contains the code implementation of Fast Multipole Method(FMM) and results. Although the performance is far from the well-written ones in MATLAB or Julia, it highlights the basic ideas of FMM.

Currently there has been some untackled bugs in this code implementation. Bugs are mainly due to wrong implementation of M2M, L2L, M2L operators. The basic framework is correct.
